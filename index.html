  <h2>What is ice cream？</h2>
  <img src="icecream10.jpg"Icecream">
  <h4>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</h4>

<h4>tips: Core techniques for ice-free slag</h4>

<li>Reduce water: Replace some of the sugar with high-fat light cream (such as Blue Windmill light cream with 38% fat), condensed milk or white chocolate. ‌</li>

<li>Whipped cream: Whip the light cream to 6-7 degrees (just formed), and add air to enhance the smoothness.  ‌</li>

<li>Stir in batches: Stir once per hour for 3-4 times during freezing to prevent ice formation.‌</li>
